Internal Cues Don’t Affect Muscle Activation with Explosive Lift...
Bodybuilders preach the importance of the “mind-muscle connection.” However, when you’re actually putting full effort into your reps, does that focus on the target muscle actually affect muscle activation?

[12:15 PM] pondX: The presence (+) or absence (-) of hyperinsulinemia was documented in these articles as follows: central obesity (4+ vs 0-), diabetes (5+ vs 0-), hypertension (9+ vs 1-), dyslipidemia (2+ vs 0-), renal failure (4+ vs 0-), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5+ vs 0-), polycystic ovary syndrome (7+ vs 1-), sleep apnea (7+ vs 0-), certain cancers (4+ vs 1-), atherosclerosis (4+ vs 0-), and cardiovascular disease (8+ vs 0-). Four articles examined insulin levels in the metabolic syndrome as a whole (4+ vs 0-).
[12:17 PM] pondX: These data document that disorders linked to the metabolic syndrome are associated with high levels of insulin, suggesting that these diseases share a common etiology that is expressed by high levels of insulin. This leads us to propose the concept of a "hyperinsulinemic syndrome" and question the safety of insulin as a chronic therapy for patients with T2DM.

[5:41 PM] pondX: >Of all the test meals, the whey meal resulted in the most pronounced amino acid responses in postprandial blood; leucine, alanine, lysine, valine, threonine, isoleucine, and proline yielding the highest peaks, which ranged from 0.13 to 0.17 mmol/L.(edited)
[5:42 PM] pondX: >After the cod meal, plasma concentrations of all amino acids were <0.06 mmol/L, except for lysine and alanine, which reached their highest values after 120 min: 0.12 and 0.10 mmol/L, respectively.(edited)
[5:43 PM] pondX: >A correlation was found between postprandial insulin responses and early increments in plasma amino acids; the strongest correlations were seen for leucine, valine, lysine, and isoleucine.
[5:45 PM] pondX: >Of the 7 amino acids that reached the highest increments after the whey meal in the current study, the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine), lysine, and threonine are all known to stimulate insulin secretion (20, 36, 38). Alanine might also have insulinotropic effects under select experimental conditions (39).

Examining the Health Effects of Fructose

[3:35 PM] ShinyPants: "Within the parameters of this study, the Prowler sled push scores demonstrated a very high degree of
reliability and should be considered a reliable test for measuring horizontal plane power output in High School male football players. The Prowler resistance
sled is a versatile training implement with a high degree of task specificity and ease of use. Further, the
Prowler sled push, when used to assess horizontal plane power output, is an easily administered test
which is specific to a number of sport tasks. "(edited)

[6:47 PM] Mauzer: "For breakfast you need to eat four of those breakfast sandwiches from McDonalds. I don't care which ones you get, but make sure to get four. Order four hash browns, too. Now grab two packs of mayonnaise and put them on the hash browns and then slip them into the sandwiches. Squish that shit down and eat. That's your breakfast.

For lunch you're gonna eat Chinese food. Now I don't want you eating that crappy stuff. You wanna get the stuff with MSG. None of that non-MSG bullshit. I don't care what you eat but you have to sit down and eat for at least 45 minutes straight. You can't let go of the fork. Eat until your eyes swell up and become slits and you start to look like the woman behind the counter.

For dinner you're gonna order an extra-large pizza with everything on it. Literally everything. If you don't like sardines, don't put 'em on, but anything else that you like you have to load it on there. After you pay the delivery guy, I want you to take the pie to your coffee table, open that fucker up, and grab a bottle of oil. It can be olive oil, canola oil, whatever. Anything but motor oil. And I want you to pour that shit over the pie until half of the bottle is gone. Just soak the shit out of it.

Now before you lay into it, I want you to sit on your couch and just stare at that fucker. I want you to understand that that pizza right there is keeping you from your goals.

Now you're on the clock, after 20 minutes your brain is going to tell you you're full. Don't listen to that shit. You have to try and eat as much of the pizza as you can before that 20-minute mark. Double up pieces if you have to. I'm telling you now, you're going to get three or four pieces in and you're gonna want to quit. You fucking can't quit. You have to sit on that couch until every piece is done.
[6:47 PM] Mauzer: And if you can't finish it, don't you ever come back to me and tell me you can't gain weight. 'Cause I'm gonna tell you that you don't give a fuck about getting bigger and you don't care how much you lift!"
