Internal Cues Don’t Affect Muscle Activation with Explosive Lift...
Bodybuilders preach the importance of the “mind-muscle connection.” However, when you’re actually putting full effort into your reps, does that focus on the target muscle actually affect muscle activation?

[12:15 PM] pondX: The presence (+) or absence (-) of hyperinsulinemia was documented in these articles as follows: central obesity (4+ vs 0-), diabetes (5+ vs 0-), hypertension (9+ vs 1-), dyslipidemia (2+ vs 0-), renal failure (4+ vs 0-), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5+ vs 0-), polycystic ovary syndrome (7+ vs 1-), sleep apnea (7+ vs 0-), certain cancers (4+ vs 1-), atherosclerosis (4+ vs 0-), and cardiovascular disease (8+ vs 0-). Four articles examined insulin levels in the metabolic syndrome as a whole (4+ vs 0-).
[12:17 PM] pondX: These data document that disorders linked to the metabolic syndrome are associated with high levels of insulin, suggesting that these diseases share a common etiology that is expressed by high levels of insulin. This leads us to propose the concept of a "hyperinsulinemic syndrome" and question the safety of insulin as a chronic therapy for patients with T2DM.

[5:41 PM] pondX: >Of all the test meals, the whey meal resulted in the most pronounced amino acid responses in postprandial blood; leucine, alanine, lysine, valine, threonine, isoleucine, and proline yielding the highest peaks, which ranged from 0.13 to 0.17 mmol/L.(edited)
[5:42 PM] pondX: >After the cod meal, plasma concentrations of all amino acids were <0.06 mmol/L, except for lysine and alanine, which reached their highest values after 120 min: 0.12 and 0.10 mmol/L, respectively.(edited)
[5:43 PM] pondX: >A correlation was found between postprandial insulin responses and early increments in plasma amino acids; the strongest correlations were seen for leucine, valine, lysine, and isoleucine.
[5:45 PM] pondX: >Of the 7 amino acids that reached the highest increments after the whey meal in the current study, the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine), lysine, and threonine are all known to stimulate insulin secretion (20, 36, 38). Alanine might also have insulinotropic effects under select experimental conditions (39).
